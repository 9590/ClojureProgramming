The official repository of sample projects and example code featured in [Clojure Programming](http://www.clojurebook.com).

**Please note that this repo is in flux**.  We've not yet done a final
test on all of the sample projects, and REPL interaction logs from the
inline book content will be added shortly.

Of course, please feel free to watch this repo, [follow @ClojureBook on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/ClojureBook), or subscribe to the book's
mailing list on [clojurebook.com](http://clojurebook.com) to be notified
when significant changes and improvements happen here.
